            <br>
            <p>what should i do about that? i have an iphone and a laptop and few people who may act for me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>should i start by writing a script?</p>
            <br>
            <p>it is a time intensive thing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>am i too old to do that?</p>
            <br>
            <p>no, i can do that. and i will do that.</p>

            <p>I have endless ideas and things I want to do, but once I start watching How I Met Your Mother, I can't stop at one episode. Maybe that's how these shows are made. They do add value to my life, but only if I stay in control. Next time, I'll watch with awareness.</p>
